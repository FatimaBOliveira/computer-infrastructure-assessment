# Computer Infrastructure Assessment

This repository contains my work for the module Computer Infrastructure in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).

This README follows the the instructions from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in how to write README files.

## About this project

 This repository contains the following:
 - directories and files created by command line prompt; 
 - a notebook, [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/computer-infrastructure-assessment/blob/main/weather.ipynb), explaining how to use the shell and how to complete the tasks;
 - a script, [weather.sh](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/computer-infrastructure-assessment/blob/main/weather.sh), that contains a list of commands that can be run when the script is executed in the command line;
 - the requirements.txt file, generated when following the instructions presented by [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/main/docs/python/managing-required-packages-with-requirements-txt.md), using the code `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in the command line. This file will make my repository readable on other computers, where the Python version installed is different from mine, specifying the packages that are needed to run my notebook;
 - And finally, this repository has a Workflow, .github/workflows/, that automates the script daily.

## Purpose of this project

The main objective of this work is to get used to the command line environment, and understand how it works and how powerful it can be.

## How to get started with the project

I used [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) to carry out my work for this module, and I followed the walkthrough in my notebook, [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/computer-infrastructure-assessment/blob/main/weather.ipynb). The python code found in the notebook follows the [PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) coding style as standard.

## Installation

In order to complete the assessment for this module, the following programs have to be installed in the computer: 
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), where Python is included;
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Usage

The notebook, [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/computer-infrastructure-assessment/blob/main/weather.ipynb), contains all the steps needed to perform the tasks through the command line environment.

Regarding the project, the workflow, .github/workflows/, ...

## Dependencies

The completion of the tasks is fulfilled through the cloud GitHub Codespaces and the used data, available in [Met Eireann](https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today). The requirement.txt is also essential as mentioned above regarding Python compatibility. The notebook weather.ipynb includes valuable researches that support my work.
