# Computer Infrastructure Assessment

This repository contains my work for the module Computer Infrastructure in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).
 
This README follows the the instructions from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in how to write README files.

## About this project
 
 This repository contains directories and files created by command line prompt. It also has a notebook, [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/computer-infrastructure-assessment/blob/main/data/weather.ipynb), explaining how to use the shell to do this work. It also contains a script that contains a list of commands that can be run when script in executed in the terminal.

## Purpose of this project

The main objective of this work is to get used to the command line environment, to understand how it works and how powerful it can be.

## How to get started with the project

I use GitHub Codespaces to carry out my project for this module, and I follow the walkthrough in my notebook.
