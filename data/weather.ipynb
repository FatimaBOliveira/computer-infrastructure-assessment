    "# Walkthrough of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will explain the steps taken to execute the requested tasks for this module, 1 to 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tasks I can use many different [command line applications](https://www.linfo.org/command_line_lesson_1.html), like [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki), [Homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)), [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ#what-is-oh-my-zsh-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-zsh), depending on their availability on the different [software systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), per example macOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can also do this tasks virtually in the cloud, through [GitHub codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#what-is-a-codespace), available in any machine. This cloud environment follows the [Linux shell bash commands](https://www.linfo.org/command.html). In this walkthrough I will use GitHub Codespaces to perform this tasks, as based on the lectures given in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Linux explains, a [command line](https://www.linfo.org/command_line.html) is \"...an instruction given by a human to tell a computer to do something.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the codes used can differ, depending on the command line used, but many of them are the same because they come from a common origin, build initially with [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell#Early_shells) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After that many [other developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#History), like the [MS-DOS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-the-evolution-of-the-windows-command-line/#microsoft-%E2%80%93-unix-market-leader-yes-seriously), are based on them, expanding the functionality of shells with new commands and modifying some features.\n",
