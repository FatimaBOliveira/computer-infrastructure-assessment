    "To complete these tasks I can use many different [command line applications](https://www.linfo.org/command_line_lesson_1.html), like [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki), [Homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)), [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ#what-is-oh-my-zsh-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-zsh), depending on their availability on the different [software systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), per example macOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can also do these tasks virtually in the cloud, through [GitHub codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#what-is-a-codespace), available on any machine.

In this walkthrough, I will use GitHub Codespaces to perform these tasks, based on the lectures given in this module.\n",

    "Some of the codes used can differ, depending on the command line used, but many of them are the same because they come from a common origin, built initially with [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell#Early_shells) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After that many [other developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#History), like the [MS-DOS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-the-evolution-of-the-windows-command-line/#microsoft-%E2%80%93-unix-market-leader-yes-seriously), are based on them, expanding the functionality of shells with new commands and modifying some features.\n",
